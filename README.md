# ðŸ•’ Take A Break

**Take A Break** is a minimalist desktop timer app built in Python to remember to slow down and get up from the chair to stretch a little, especially on those long days when we are sitting for many hours at a time. The idea is to have an app where you can customize the sound of the timer to your liking and select both your own time and mode for practicing the Pomodoro technique or taking regular breaks to stay healthy and focused.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Simple timer or complete work/break cycles
- Custom alerts with sound and optional pop-up
- Dark/light theme toggle
- User-friendly GUI with sidebar configuration
- Persistent settings saved between sessions
- Lightweight executable â€“ no need to install Python!


## ðŸš€ How to Run

Download the `.exe` from the [Releases section](https://github.com/rickyrivero/TakeABreak/releases) and double click to run.

âœ… No installation or Python required.

I recommend to download my [alarm.mp3](https://github.com/rickyrivero/TakeABreak/blob/main/assets/alarm.mp3) form the section assets to have a chill alarm to use by default, if you want to have another alarm just download it in mp3 format and select it in the app options. The file can be in any directory of your convenience.

## Gerenal idea

You have 2 options to use. The first one is the "Simple timer" which runs 1 cycle at a time, once the selected time is over the alarm will go on but to continue another cycle you have to click the start button again. The second one is the "Complete timer" with two timer inputs, one is the work time and the other is the break time, you can edit that for your convenience; also this timer runs for as many cycle as you want, as itarates over and over again, you can stop at any time with the buttons or close the app.
